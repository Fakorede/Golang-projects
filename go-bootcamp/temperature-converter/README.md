# CelsiusToFahrenheit

### Explanation

This program uses the `os.Args` function to accept any value as argument from the terminal.

This value is usually a string and is converted to a float using `strconv.ParseFloat`.

The value which is assumed to be a temperature in Celsius is then converted to a value in Fahrenheit.

### Usage

```
go run main.go 20
```
