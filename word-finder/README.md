# Word Finder

A Simple Search Engine.

### How the Game Works?

The program searches for a query/words provided as argument in the `corpus` and returns the first instances of each query and its position. The search is case-insensitive.

### Usage

```
go run main.go again and
```

> where again & and are the arguments/query

### Example Output

```
#4 : "again"
#5 : "and"
```
